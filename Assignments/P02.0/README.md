## Project 2.0 - Platformer
#### Landen Jones
#### Description: This program utilizes pygame and displays a player on the screen as a fluffy rabbit. You control the player's movement by using the {Left, Right} ARROW keys and the {SPACE} key. The arrow keys allow the player to move from left to right while the space key allows the player to move upwards(HOLD space to jump higher). Gravity is a thing, so while you're not standing on a platorm you while begin to fall, and if you jump and stay in the air long enough, you will begin to fall.
